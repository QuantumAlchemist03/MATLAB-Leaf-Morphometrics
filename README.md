# MATLAB-Leaf-Morphometrics
This project implements a "Leaf Morphometric Analysis" workflow: segments a leaf and coin via thresholding, cleans masks with morphological operations, and extracts features (centroid, GLI). It also calculates real-world measurements (area, length, perimeter) using the coin for scale and adapts this for multi-leaf images.
